# CloneGoodside Documentation

## 1. Introduction
CloneGoodside is an AI-powered clone agent designed to act as your digital version. It can mimic your voice and engage in conversations that reflect your personality. By learning from your speech and text patterns, CloneGoodside can serve as a virtual extension of yourself, making interactions feel natural and personalized.

## 2. Stack
CloneGoodside is built using a modern AI stack optimized for performance and flexibility:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI for API development
- **AI Models**: OpenAI's Whisper for speech recognition, Eleven Labs for voice synthesis (others soon)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage (‚ùå)
- **Message Queue**: Redis for handling async tasks (‚ùå)
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment (‚ùå)
- **LLM Frameworks**: LangChain and LangGraph üÜï
- **Other AI Models**: Additional integrations under development

## 3. How to Install

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional for containerized deployment) ‚ùå

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:

   cd IcalAI
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. (Optional) Run using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## 4. Current Capabilities
CloneGoodside currently supports the following features:

### Access Internet Knowledge Base üÜï
- Integrated with Search Tools API to look for information on the internet
- Automatically trigger internet search when the LLM does not know the information

### Voice Cloning (_Work In Progress_)
- Generates a synthetic voice that closely mimics the provided audio sample.
- Uses Eleven Labs' state-of-the-art deep learning models for high-fidelity voice synthesis.

### Simple Chat Capabilities with memories
- Engages in basic text-based conversations with memories. üÜï
- Supports predefined responses and limited contextual awareness.

## 5. Future Capabilities
### Enhanced AI Abilities
1. **Adaptive Communication Style**: Users will be able to upload text samples to train CloneGoodside on their writing style, ensuring responses match their natural tone, phrasing, and level of formality.
2. **Personalized Memory and Context Awareness**: Future updates will enable CloneGoodside to retain conversational history, allowing for deeper, more contextualized interactions over time.
3. **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Beyond text and voice, CloneGoodside will support interactions through images and videos, expanding its expressive capabilities.

## 6. Security and Ethical Guidelines
CloneGoodside is designed with security and ethical considerations in mind:
- **User Consent**: Voice and text data should only be used with the explicit consent of the original owner.
- **Data Privacy**: All stored data is encrypted and securely managed to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Ethical AI Usage**: This AI should not be used for impersonation, fraud, or misleading activities. Users must comply with ethical and legal standards when deploying CloneGoodside.
- **Access Control**: API keys and authentication mechanisms are in place to prevent misuse and unauthorized access.

Future updates will introduce advanced reasoning, memory retention, and multi-modal interactions. Stay tuned!
